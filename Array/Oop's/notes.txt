Oop's (Object Oriented Programming Structure);
There are six types of oops
1.class
2.Object/method
3.Inheritence
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Capsulation
now we explain one by one....
class :- class is a collection of object and method.. or class is a template or blueprint or prototype.
class is not real world entity..
class is not occupy memory
ex :- Animals,Birds,Fruits etc
Animals(class) ---->dog,cow,cat etc...(object).
Syntax :-
access modifier class ClassName{
   -> method
   -> constructors
   -> fields
   -> blocks
   -> nested class
}

Method :- Method is a set of code which is perform a particular task...
Advantage:-
code reusability
code optimization

Object :- Object is a instance of class
object is a real world entity
object is occupy of memory;
